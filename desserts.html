        <p>Almond Tofu: soft and sweet tofu that almost makes it seem like you're eating a nice dream</p>
        <p>Sakura Mochi: a cold dessert that still warms you up like snow on the hearth</p>
        <p>Lotus Flower Crisp: a mix of different sweets slowly deep fried until it splits and blooms like a flower</p>
        <p>Tea Break Pancakes: miniture pancakes that aren't too heavy but still make even a mediocre teatime better</p>
